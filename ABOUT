processes input .txt files and performs matrix addition and multiplication

this is done by creating a linked list where each node in the list holds a tuple holding the 
location and value in the matrix 

the matrix is described by the sp_tuples data struct which defines the size, 
count of non-zero values, and the head pointer of the linked list of tuple nodes
